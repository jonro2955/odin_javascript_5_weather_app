#odin_javascript_5_weather_app

preview:

This is a weather app using JavaScript asynchronous fetch methods to retrieve openweathermap.org API weather data in JSON form and to creatively display that data onto the webpage. It uses localStorage browser memory to save multiple cities as specified by the user and displays each of their weather information in standard sized weather "cards" on the webpage. Additional giphy.com API calls are implemented in response to each city's weather data in order to create a visual effect on the background of each city's "card" corresponding to its current weather condition. 

It uses both promises and async/await methods of asynchronous API calls, Webpack resource loading, Webpack output splitting, ESLint, and Prettier. Project instructions can be found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app
